// Description:
//              Create an functioning Employee class that will be inherited by 3 functional other classes, ProductionWorker,
//              ShiftSupervisor, and TeamLeader. Use a file called mycomp.cpp to test all, including << operator overloading
//              for ShiftSupervisor
//
